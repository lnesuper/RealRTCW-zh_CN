^8DEATHSHEAD'S PLAYGROUND^8

^8Part 1: Ice Station Norway^8

Your interrogation of the officer in the SWF has yielded the location of Deathshead's "X-Labs" in occupied Norway.  Our defecting SWF scientist has also revealed the nature of what is taking place at the "X-Labs"; project "Uber Soldat", or Super Soldier.  This is Deathshead's most advanced technology project, apparently combining robotic and biological engineering to create the "ultimate killing machine".  By itself this super soldier could pose a considerable threat to the Allies, but it appears that this project may have some other connection to the SS Paranormal Division.  



任务5:
死颅的游乐场


第一部分:挪威冰站


你对SWF的官员的审问已经得到了死颅在被占领的挪威的“x-Labs的位置。我们的变节的主权财富基金科学家也揭示了在“X-Labs”发生的事情的本质;“超级战士”项目。这是“死颅”最先进的技术项目，显然结合了机器人和生物工程来创造“终极杀人机器”。就其本身而言，这个超级战士可能会对盟军造成相当大的威胁，但似乎这个项目可能与党卫军超自然部门有一些其他的联系。
