^8Part 4: Secret Weapons Facility^8

Besides advanced weapons research and development, the OSA has very little information on what goes on inside the SWF.  Kreisau Circle intelligence does suggest that the SWF contains a U-boat pen that may be used as a debarkation point for another of Deathshead's secret research projects, although we have no idea what that might be at this time. Also be on the lookout for advanced weapons proto-types.

The bombing raid has made a mess of communications topside, so you should be able to enter the facility without their knowledge.




任务四:致命的设计


第四部分:秘密武器设施


除了先进的武器研发，OSA对SWF内部的情况知之甚少。克瑞索圈情报机构确实认为，SWF中有一支u型潜艇笔，可能被用作另一个“死亡之头”秘密研究项目的登陆点，尽管我们目前还不知道那是什么。也要注意先进武器原型。

轰炸突袭把上层的通讯搞得一团糟，所以你应该可以在他们不知情的情况下进入基地。
