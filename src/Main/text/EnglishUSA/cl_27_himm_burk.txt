To:  General Burkhalter 
From: Reichsfuhrer SS Heinrich Himmler

Congratulations on being selected as a Meta-Psychic Controller.  It is a great honor but also a great responsibility.  Only you and your colleagues, by exercising the necessary controls, can guarantee success and prevent utter chaos.  I direct you to weigh the matter heavily.  I also direct you to put aside any petty differences.  I know your feelings about Madame Blavatsky; but understand that, despite your objections, she is in charge of the ceremony.  She has my complete confidence and I expect you to obey her orders as you would my own.

Heinrich Himmler, Reichsfuhrer SS

恭喜你被选为元心理控制者。这是一个巨大的荣誉，但也是一个巨大的责任。只有你和你的同事，通过实施必要的控制，才能保证成功，防止完全混乱。我指示你把这件事斟酌得很重。我还指示你把任何微小的分歧放在一边。我知道你对布拉瓦茨基夫人的感情，但要明白，尽管你反对，她还是负责婚礼的。她对我完全有信心，我希望你像我一样服从她的命令。
