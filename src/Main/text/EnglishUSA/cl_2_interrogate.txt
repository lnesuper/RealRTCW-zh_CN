Interrogation Report - March 17, 1943

Subject: Unknown
Interrogator: Doctor Zee

Very little information was divulged by this subject.  He was subjected to 77% standard current before expiring.  We did discover a cyanide tablet hidden in a compartment of the subjects boot.  This discovery leads us to believe that he and his accomplice are allied spies, although we have not determined at this time which agency they may be working for.

I believe that I will achieve better results from his accomplice.

Subject time of death: 15:35



审讯报告——1943年3月17日


主题:未知

审讯员:蔡医生


这个题目透露的信息很少。他在到期前受到77%的标准电流。我们确实在受试者靴子的一个隔间里发现了一颗氰化物药片。这一发现使我们相信他和他的同谋是同谋间谍，虽然我们现在还不能确定他们为哪个机关工作。


我相信从他的同伙那里我会取得更好的成绩。


死亡时间:15:35
