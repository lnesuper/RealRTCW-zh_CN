               OPERATION RESURRECTION

Phase III:  Resurrection

The ceremony is to take place at our
holiest site during the most favorable
alignment of Saturn and Mars.

A minimum of three Hosts shall be prepared
as described in the ancient texts (see
note).

 Note - For the sake of redundancy, six
 was agreed upon as the optimal number of
 hosts.

The presiding Mystic Adept, Madame
Blavatsky, shall open the ceremony with 
an encantation as the Life Essence Elixer
is absorbed into the bodies of the 
initiates.  Shortly thereafter she shall 
utter the 'Annointment Invocation', 
imbueing each host in its turn with 
the Dark Life Essence.



复活行动


第三阶段：复活


仪式将在我们最喜欢的土星和火星连成一线的最神圣的地点举行。


按照古代文献(见注释)的描述，至少应准备三个主机。


注意-为了冗余，6台被认为是最佳的主机数量。



秘术大师布拉瓦茨基夫人，以生命精华被吸收到提升者体内时，将以咒语开启仪式。不久之后，她将发出“召唤咒语”，依次向每个主人灌输黑暗力量。
