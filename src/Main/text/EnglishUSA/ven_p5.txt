cartridge case, resulting in massive stoppage. As the feeder/delinker components were encased in a solid outer housing, only by removing the feeder/delinker system from the gun and disassembling it, using a pry bar to force the gears around, could clear the stoppage. This was a major project that took at least 20 minutes.

To alleviate the situation we have installed a hinged hatch on the feeder/delinker housing for easier access. Since it's a two piece unit, the hatch also permits placing the belt by hand into the proper position for firing, just like a standard belt fed machine gun's top cover (in fact, the hinged locking latch on the hatch was taken directly from the American's .50 caliber Browning machine gun's top cover).  

Final Analysis:

We have recently completed 3 separate 100,000 round tests with the improved GP-VG MK2 Venom Gun. The results were phenomenal. There was only one stoppage, which was cleared in a matter of seconds. As directed, the Venom Gun is ready for deployment and is the most precisely directed and most devastating small arm weapon currently available anywhere in the world.


由于进料器/脱链器组件被装在坚固的外壳中，只有从喷枪上取下进料器/脱链器系统，然后用撬杆将齿轮撬动才能拆下，才能清除堵塞。这是一个耗时至少20分钟的重大项目。

为了缓解这种情况，我们在进料器/脱粒器壳体上安装了一个铰接式舱口，以便于检修。由于它是两件式装置，因此舱口盖还允许用手将安全带放置在适当的射击位置，就像标准的皮带式机枪的顶盖一样（实际上，舱口上的铰接锁闩直接取自美国人的.50口径勃朗宁机枪的顶盖）。

最终分析：

我们最近使用改进的GP-VG MK2毒液喷枪完成了3个单独的100,000轮测试。
结果是惊人的。只要一个停顿，在几秒钟内就清除了。按照指示，毒液枪已准备好部署，并且是目前世界上任何地方都可以使用的最精确，最具破坏性的轻武器。
