To: Secretary Giereg
From: Major Jurgen

I am well aware of Reichsmarshall Directive 197, however I admit to being at a complete loss as to why you should consider it necessary to remind me of it.  We have always been operating within full compliance of the law and all such items not deemed essential to the current project have been swiftly forwarded to the Reichsmarshall's office.  Let me assure you that absolutely nothing has been withheld and that no hoarding of any kind has been taking place here.

Regards,
Major Wilhelm Jurgen
Security Officer, Castle Wolfenstein

我很清楚国会《第197号法令》，但我承认完全不明白你为什么认为有必要提醒我。我们一直在完全遵守法律的情况下运作，所有这些被认为对当前项目不重要的项目都被迅速转交给了国会议员办公室。我向你保证，这里绝对没有任何隐瞒，也没有发生任何形式的囤积。
