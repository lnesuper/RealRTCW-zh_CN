^8Part 1: Bramburg Dam^8

The mission to the "X-Labs" had the effect of driving Deathshead into hiding; at this time his whereabouts are unknown.  However, it is now known that he was only a supporting character in Himmler's ultimate goal; to resurrect Heinrich I.  It appears that three of Deathshead's Super Soldiers will be "anointed" by Marianna Blavatsky in a ceremony to be held near Chateau Shufstaffel in the village of Paderborn.  They will then be brought to the grave of Heinrich I located near Castle Wolfenstein for the "Resurrection".  While many in the OSA remain skeptical of this ceremony, recent events have shown that nothing can be ruled out.

 
任务6:回归契约

第一部分:布朗伯格大坝

“X-Labs”的任务产生了驱使死颅躲藏起来的效果;目前他下落不明。然而，现在人们知道，他只是希姆莱最终目标中的一个配角;为了复活海因里希一世，死颅的三名超级战士似乎将在帕德博恩村的舒夫斯塔菲尔城堡附近举行的仪式上接受玛丽安娜·布拉瓦茨基的“吟诵”。然后，他们将被带到位于沃尔芬斯坦城堡附近的海因里希一世的坟墓里进行“复活”。虽然许多OSA人仍然对这个仪式持怀疑态度，但最近的事件表明，没有什么是可以排除的。
