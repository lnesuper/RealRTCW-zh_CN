The area is lightly guarded, but there are alarm stations scattered throughout.  If any alarms are sounded the base will be alerted and the mission will be scrubbed.  If you encounter any enemies, eliminate them before they can sound an alarm.  Remember: Do not eliminate the final guard who controls access into the compound; if you do, the supply truck will not be able to get inside the rocket base.






















该地区戒备薄弱，但到处都有报警站。一旦警报响起，基地就会收到警报，任务也会被取消。如果你遇到任何敌人，在他们发出警报之前消灭他们。记住:不要消灭最后一个控制进入院落的警卫;如果你这样做，补给车将无法进入火箭基地。
