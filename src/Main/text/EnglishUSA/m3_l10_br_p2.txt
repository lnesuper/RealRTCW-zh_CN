^8Part 2: Rocket Base^8

German resistance informs us that the rocket Deathshead intends to fire at London carries some kind of new chemical warhead, the total destructiveness of which is currently unknown.

German resistance also informs us that all of these rockets have a "self-destruct" switch, usually located in the main rocket control room.  Unfortunately, we know virtually nothing of the interior layout of the base.  It will be up to you to determine the best means of reaching the main control room so that you can destroy the rocket before it reaches London.  

After destroying the rocket it is likely that the base will be on full alert.  Use all means available to exit the base and proceed to the outer compound.


任务3:复仇武器


第二部分:火箭基地


德国抵抗者组织告诉我们，死颅打算在伦敦发射火箭，它携带了某种新的化学弹头，其总破坏力目前还不清楚。


德国抵抗者组织还告诉我们，所有这些火箭都有一个“自毁”开关，通常位于主火箭控制室。不幸的是，我们对基地的内部布局几乎一无所知。这将由你来决定到达主控制室的最佳方式，这样你就可以在火箭到达伦敦之前摧毁它。


摧毁火箭后，基地很可能会处于高度戒备状态。用尽一切可能的方法离开基地，继续向外推进。
