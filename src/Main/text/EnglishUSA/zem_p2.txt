Very upset with how things are progressing. The work is getting sloppy.  Everyone in too much of a rush.  Ignoring precautions.  Certain corners just cannot be cut.  Those old mystics were far too clever for that.  Helga is the worst offender of all.  And she is supposed to be overseeing us!  Doesn't she remember 1939?
