^8Part 2: The Bombed Factory^8
 
The first part of the SWF industrial complex is the weapons factory.  Various aircraft and heavy weapons were being manufactured here before the bombing raid.  Intelligence has learned that this was also to be one of the manufacturing points for the Nazi's new "Venom" machine gun.  This weapon has been rumored to have an incredible rate of fire, and if it is half as powerful as reports would indicate could pose a serious threat to the Allies.

The defecting scientist has confirmed  the reports that there is a "Venom Gun" project book located somewhere in the factory which contains all of that weapon's technical information and specifications.  



任务四:致命的设计


第二部分:被轰炸的工厂


SWF工业园区的第一部分是武器工厂。轰炸袭击之前，各种飞机和重型武器都在这里生产。情报部门了解到，这也是纳粹新“毒液”机枪的制造点之一。据传闻，这种武器的射速令人难以置信，如果它的威力只有报道的一半，就会对盟军构成严重威胁。

叛变的科学家已经证实了在工厂的某个地方有一本“毒液枪”项目书，里面包含了所有武器的技术信息和规格。
