To:  General Von Stauff 
From: SS Oberfuhrer Blavatsky

My Dear General
I was overjoyed to hear that you were one of the chosen few.  I can think of no one more deserving of that honor.  On the other hand, I was totally dejected when I learned Burkhalter was also chosen.  I know you think the world of him, but I absolutely detest him and his arrogance.  Still I must give the devil his due.  He has the talent and, for the purpose of maintaining the meta-psychic link, that is paramount.  At least there will be one friend present whose support I can count on.

我亲爱的将军

听说你是少数几个被选中的人之一，我欣喜若狂。我想没有人比他更值得得到这个荣誉了。另一方面，当我得知伯克勒也被选中时，我完全沮丧。我知道你认为他的世界，但我绝对讨厌他和他的傲慢。但我还是要给魔鬼应得的。他有天赋，为了保持元心理联系，这是最重要的。至少会有一个朋友在场，我可以指望他的支持。
