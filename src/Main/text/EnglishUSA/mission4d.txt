Met up with German resistance (Kreisau Circle) members at outskirts of Kugelstadt, which had just undergone intensive allied bombing.  Orders to infiltrate SS Secret Weapons Facility (SWF).  Kreisau agents used captured Panzer to break into facility. Entered SWF and obtained detailed plans and working prototype of new Venom Gun.  Encountered strange, mutated loping creature inside SWF.  Apparently a test subject for Venom Gun firing rates.  Necessary to exterminate all encountered as they posed serious physical threat to self.  Unable to find Deathshead, but was able to learn location of his "X-Labs" in occupied Norway.
