^8Part 2: Paderborn Village^8

Paderborn, home to many of Germany's leading occultists, is currently hosting the elite of the SS Paranormal Division.  As learned in recently decoded SS transmissions, Marianna Blavatsky will perform a ritual termed "Anointing of the Dark Knights".  The ceremony is scheduled to take place somewhere near Chateau Schufstaffel.  Resistance Intelligence tells us the only viable route into the chateau is through the village, as it is the least guarded path.  However, there is a general alarm somewhere in the village near the chateau.  If the alarm is raised there will be no chance of getting inside.  

  




任务6：回归契约


第2部分：帕德伯恩村


帕德伯恩是许多德国著名神秘学家的家乡，目前正在接待党卫军超自然师的精英。正如在最近破译的党卫军传输中所了解到的，玛丽安娜·布拉瓦茨基将执行一个称为“黑暗骑士的招魂仪式”。仪式预定在舒夫塔菲尔城堡附近的某个地方举行。抵抗情报告诉我们，进入城堡的唯一可行的途径是穿过村庄，因为这是守卫最少的途径。然而，在城堡附近的村子里有一个普遍的警报。如果警报响起，就没有机会进去。
