Your mission is to infiltrate Chateau Shufstaffel and stop this ceremony at all costs.  To reduce the chances of alerting the enemy, you will be air dropped near a dam two kilometers from Paderborn. You must cross the dam to reach Paderborn, and from there gain access to the chateau.  A silent approach is your best option.  Once in Paderborn you are to assassinate the Paranormal Division officers and discover the exact location of the ceremonies. Should you arrive too late, proceed with all speed to Castle Wolfenstein and ensure the "Resurrection" does not take place.


你的任务是潜入舒夫塔菲尔城堡，不惜一切代价阻止这个仪式。为了减少与敌人交火的机会，你将被空投到距离帕德伯恩两公里的水坝附近。你必须穿过水坝才能到达帕德伯恩，然后从那里进入城堡。潜入是你最好的选择。一旦进入帕德伯恩，你就要暗杀超自然现象部门的军官，并发现仪式的确切地点。如果你来的太晚，全速前往沃尔芬斯坦城堡，确保“复活”仪式不会发生。
