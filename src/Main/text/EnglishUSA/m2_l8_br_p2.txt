^8Part 4:  The Defiled Church^8

Residents of Wulfburg call this "The Defiled Church". It apparently has a rather sordid history dating back 1000 years.  Over the ages it has been rumored to have been used for a number of occult ceremonies.  Rumors aside, we do know that Helga von Bulow and her SS Paranormal Division team are there now.  We do not know what they are planning, so it is imperative that you investigate and recover as much intelligence information as possible.

A word of caution; the Kreisau Circle has reported that Helga von Bulow's "Elite Guard" is made up of a small group of extremely capable women who have been trained to an exceptionally high level, both physically and with small arms.  They also reportedly bound together as part of a witch's coven.


任务2:黑暗的秘密


第四部分:被玷污的教会


伍尔夫堡的居民称之为“被玷污的教堂”。它的历史可以追溯到1000年前。多年来，一直有传言说它被用于一些神秘的仪式。且不说谣言，我们确实知道黑尔加·冯·布洛和她的党卫军超自然现象小组现在就在那里。我们不知道他们在策划什么，所以你必须尽可能多地调查和恢复情报信息。


警告;克瑞索集团报道说，黑尔加·冯·比洛的“精英卫队”是由一小群极有能力的女性组成的，她们的身体和小胳膊都经过了非常高水平的训练。据报道，他们还作为女巫集会的一部分绑在一起。
