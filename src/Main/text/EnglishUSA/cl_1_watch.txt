Subject: Alert Status

As you are all aware, the SS Paranormal Division has had tremendous success in their recent archeological efforts near the village.  However, Oberst Helga von Bulow is extremely displeased with the level of security at Castle Wolfenstein and the village near the excavation sites.  I cannot stress how important this operation is to the Reich.

Two spies were recently discovered attempting to infiltrate the castle.  With this in mind I caution you; any breaches in security determined to be caused by watch personnel will be dealt with in the harshest manner possible.

Regards,
Major Wilhelm Jurgen
Security Officer, Castle Wolfenstein

你们都知道，党卫军超自然现象部门最近在这个村庄附近的考古工作中取得了巨大的成功。然而，奥伯斯特·黑尔加·冯·比洛对沃尔芬斯坦城堡和挖掘地点附近村庄的安全水平非常不满意。我无法强调这次行动对帝国的重要性。


最近发现两名间谍企图渗透城堡。考虑到这一点，我提醒你们;任何由值班人员造成的安全漏洞都将以最严厉的方式处理。


此致，
