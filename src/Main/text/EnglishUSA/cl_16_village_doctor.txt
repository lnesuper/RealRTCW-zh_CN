Doctor Merkwurdigliebe,

I am positively at my wit's end. The charm has worn off much sooner than you promised.  I don't know what to do now. How can I go out in the daylight looking like this?  Please, please call me as soon as you get in!

Ilsa


默克沃迪格利贝医生，


我确实是一筹莫展了。魅力消失得比你承诺的要快得多。我不知道现在该怎么办。我怎么能在大白天穿成这样出门?请一进来就给我打电话!
