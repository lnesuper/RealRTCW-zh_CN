To: All Maintenance Personnel
From: Major Vorsichtig
Subject: Unauthorized use of equipment

Effective immediately, the practice of brewing coffee in the MkII Sequential Fuel Purifier is strictly forbidden.  As anyone who witnessed the events of last Thursday can attest, the presence of even the slightest impurities within the condenser vessel can lead to a violent chemical reaction.

Anyone found in violation of this policy will be dealt with in the harshest manner imaginable.

立即生效，严禁在MkII序列燃油净化器中冲泡咖啡。 目睹上星期四的事件的任何人都可以证明，冷凝器容器内即使是最细微的杂质的存在也会导致剧烈的化学反应。

任何违反此政策的人将得到可以想象的最严厉的处理。
