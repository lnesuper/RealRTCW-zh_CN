To: Major Jurgen
From: Secretary Giereg

I wish to call your attention to Reichsmarshall Directive 197 which explicitly states that all art treasures, artifacts, and miscellaneous valuables, acquired during wartime, are to be turned over to the Minister of the Interior (Reichsmarshall Goering) for proper disposition.  Be advised that any violation of this directive will be treated as a serious criminal offense.

Dieter Giereg,
Special Assistant to the Reichsmarshall,
Ministry of the Interior

我希望提请你注意《第197号法令》，该法令明确规定，战时获得的所有艺术珍宝、手工艺品和其他贵重物品都应移交内政部长(国会议员戈林)妥善处理。请注意，任何违反此指令的行为将被视为严重的刑事犯罪。
