               OPERATION RESURRECTION

Appendix

His unlikely opponent was the enigmatic Simon the Wanderer.  A former Benedictine monk, Simon left the order to form his own mysterious sect.  With his chosen followers he traveled incessantly throughout Europe, Asia Minor, and The Far East, collecting countless items of mystical knowledge from all the ancient cultures of The Old World.  No doubt the channeling of raw fundamental, destructive forces as practiced by Heinrich would have seemed an anathema to someone of Simon's reflective and meditative nature.

The confrontation occurred - so the legend says - in 943.  After a prolonged, cataclysmic struggle, Simon and his followers, by means never revealed, managed to neutralize and slay the Dark Knights.  Their remains were entombed in undisclosed locations, painstakingly sealed against future violation.

附录


他意想不到的对手是神秘的流浪者西蒙。西蒙曾是本笃会的一名修道士，他离开了修道院，成立了自己的神秘教派。他和自己挑选的信徒们不停地游历欧洲、小亚细亚和远东地区，从旧世界的所有古代文化中收集了无数的神秘知识。毫无疑问，像海因里希所做的那样，疏导原始的基本的、破坏性的力量，对于西蒙这种沉思冥想的人来说，似乎是一种诅咒。


据传说，这场冲突发生在公元943年。经过一场漫长的，灾难性的斗争，西蒙和他的追随者，以从未透露的方式，设法中和和杀死黑暗骑士。他们的遗体被埋葬在秘密地点，为了防止未来的侵犯，他们煞费苦心地进行了封印。
