To: All Specimen Caretakers
From: Hauptmann Shmutzig

The three cases of cholera reported in the outer guard compound have been, unequivocally, traced back to improper disposal of specimen waste materials.  In future, anyone found dumping specimen waste in the local water supply will be severely reprimanded.

外护大院报告的三起霍乱病例，明确地追溯到样本废料处理不当。今后，凡发现在当地供水系统倾倒标本垃圾的，都将受到严厉谴责。
