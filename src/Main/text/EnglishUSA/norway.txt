^8Part 1: Ice Station Norway^8

Your interrogation of the officer in the SWF has yielded the location of Deathshead's "X-Labs" in occupied Norway.  Our defecting SWF scientist has also revealed the nature of what is taking place at the "X-Labs"; project Uber Soldat, or Super Soldier.  This is Deathshead's most advanced technology project, apparently combining robotic and biological engineering to create the "ultimate killing machine".  By itself this Super Soldier could pose a considerable threat to the Allies, but it appears that this project may have some other connection to the SS Paranormal Division.  

In any event, the "X-Labs" must be infiltrated at all costs; we must know what Deathshead's ultimate goal is for these Super Soldiers, and, if possible, what their connection is to the SS Paranormal Division.





任务五：死颅的游乐场


第1部分：挪威冰站


你审问了主权财富基金的官员，找到了死亡谢德在被占领挪威的“X实验室”的位置。我们叛逃的SWF科学家也揭示了在“X实验室”发生的事情的本质；Uber Soldat项目，或超级士兵。这是迪思黑德最先进的技术项目，显然是将机器人和生物工程相结合，创造出“终极杀人机器”。这名超级士兵本身可能对盟军构成相当大的威胁，但看来这个项目可能与党卫军超自然师有其他联系。


无论如何，“X实验室”必须不惜一切代价渗透进去；我们必须知道迪思黑德对这些超级士兵的最终目标是什么，如果可能的话，他们与党卫军超自然师的联系是什么。
