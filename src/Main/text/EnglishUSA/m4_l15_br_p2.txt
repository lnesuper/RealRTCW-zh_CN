^8Part 3: The Trainyards^8

The second part of the SWF industrial complex is the Train yards/Freight Depot.  Aerial Recon reports that this area appears to have been less damaged than the factory.  The real strategic importance of this area is that it is the only entrance into the Secret Weapons Facility itself, which lies underground and out of reach of Allied bombers.  

Unfortunately, our tactical knowledge of this area is minimal at best, so you must discover on your own which building contains the SWF entrance.


Note: SWF = Secret Weapons Facility


任务四:致命的设计


第三部分:火车站


SWF工业综合体的第二部分是火车站/货运站。空中侦察报告说，这个地区受到的破坏似乎比工厂小。这一地区的真正战略重要性在于，它是进入秘密武器设施的唯一入口，该设施位于地下，盟军轰炸机无法到达。


不幸的是，我们在这方面的战术知识是最少的，所以你必须自己去发现哪个建筑包含了SWF入口。



注:SWF=秘密武器设施
