               OPERATION RESURRECTION

Phase II:  Creation

Officer in charge:  
SS Special Projects Acting Administrator


Background - As early as 1938, it was
concluded that Operation Resurrection
would require the development of an
advanced synthetic, humanoid host.  A
host with specifications at the extreme
cutting edge of our present robotic and
biological sciences.  Fortunately, and
quite coincidentally, such development
was already well underway by the SS
Special Projects Division.  This was to
be the major component of their Project
Uber Soldat.  Due to our overriding
priority, the project was immediately
transferred to our jurisdiction.  Work

第二阶段：创作


主管人员：

SS特殊项目代理管理员



背景-早在1938年，人们就得出结论，复活行动将需要开发一种先进的合成类人宿主。一个在我们目前的机器人和生物科学的最前沿有规格的主机。幸运的是，非常巧合的是，党卫军特别项目部已经在进行这样的开发。这将是他们超级战士项目的主要组成部分。由于我们的首要任务，这个项目立即转移到我们的管辖区域工作。
