Debriefed Jack Stone at OSA by coded radio at Malta.   Airdropped in forest near SS rocket base at Katamarunde where I infiltrated the V2 Rocket Base through means of stealth approach.  Once inside base destroyed V2 with "dirty water" warhead aimed for London.  Fought through heavy resistance on way out to reach Experimental Aircraft Facility.  Successfully infiltrated Aircraft Facility, located launch directives and "appropriated" experimental Bachem-317 Kobra Rocket Plane.  Flew without incident back to Malta to turn over Kobra to OSA scientists.


任务3汇报


机密


在马耳他用编码无线电向奥斯塔的杰克·斯通汇报了情况。空投在卡塔马兰德党卫军火箭基地附近的森林里，我通过隐形方式潜入了V2火箭基地。一进入基地就用“脏水”弹头摧毁了V2，目标是伦敦。在前往实验性飞机设施的途中，经历了重重抵抗。成功渗透飞机设施，定位发射指令和“挪用”实验巴赫姆-317科布拉火箭飞机。毫无意外地飞回马耳他，把科布拉交给OSA的科学家。
