^8Part 2: X-labs^8

There is very little information about the "X-Labs" themselves.  Our defecting scientist worked in weapons research, and although he is aware of the existence of the "X-Labs" he has never been there.  He has however, informed us that the "X-Labs" do make extensive use of "Tesla" technology to create powerful, guided electrical fields.  These are apparently used for everything from security gating to local power generation.  It is also rumored that this technology is what drives the nervous systems of what our scientist calls the "X-creatures".  This last statement indicates that you will probably engage more of the "Lopers" that you first encountered at the Secret Weapons Facility, as well as other unknown types of "X-Creatures".

死颅的游乐场


第2部分：X实验室


关于“X实验室”本身的信息很少。我们叛逃的科学家从事武器研究，虽然他知道“X实验室”的存在，但他从未去过那里。然而，他告诉我们，“X实验室”确实广泛使用“特斯拉”技术来创造强大的、有向导的电场。这些设备显然用于从安全门到本地发电的所有方面。也有传闻说，这项技术驱动着我们科学家所称的“X生物”的神经系统。这最后一句话表明，你可能会接触更多的“lopers”，你第一次在秘密武器设施，以及其他未知类型的“X生物”。
