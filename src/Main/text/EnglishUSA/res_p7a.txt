They'll have to make do with 5.  I'm
keeping one for further testing.  I didn't
sacrifice 6 years of my life for nothing!
I'm sure Himmler will be out for my blood
once he gets wind of this.  No matter.
I'm ready to confront the Fuhrer himself
over this.



他们得用5个。我留着一个做进一步的测试。我没有白白牺牲我生命中的6年！我相信希姆莱一听到这个消息一定会为我付出代价的。没关系。我已经准备好面对元首本人了。
