Entered Village with Kessler, learned of ancient "in-human" remains discovered in an excavation site.  Found a network of crypts running below the village. Undead creatures everywhere killing everything in sight, including Krauts. Located the "Defiled Church" just as Zemph and Helga completed their "life essence" from the corpse of a "Dark Knight". What does concern the OSA is Zemph's mention of an Operation: Resurrection and how Deathshead and perhaps Himmler himself are involved.

和凯斯勒一起进村，得知在一个挖掘现场发现的古代“人类”遗骸。在村子下面发现了一个地下墓穴网络。到处都是不死生物在杀死眼前的一切，包括德国佬。就在泽姆夫和赫尔加从一个“黑暗骑士”的尸体上完成他们的“生命本质”时，找到了“被玷污的教堂”。与阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停综合征有关的是泽姆夫提到的一个手术：复活以及死亡之神和希姆莱本人是如何卷入其中的。
