To:   SS-Oberfuhrer Wilhelm (Deathshead) Strasse
From: Reichsfuhrer SS Heinrich Himmler

Willy,
It saddens me to hear that you have declined the invitation from the Paranormal Division to attend the upcoming ceremony in Paderborn. You will be missing out on a rare opportunity to witness a momentous event.  I had hoped this experience might provide you with new insight or, at the very least, cure your lingering skepticism.  I see that, once again, I am to be disappointed.

I have always considered you one the most valuable contributors to the Reich.  Were it not for your continued obstinacy in this area, there would be no limit to the support I would give you.  I urge you to reconsider.  It is not too late.

H. Himmler

威廉，

听说你谢绝了超自然师邀请我参加即将在帕德伯恩举行的仪式，我很难过。你将错过一个难得的机会去见证一个重大事件。我希望这次经历能给你提供新的见解，或者至少能治愈你挥之不去的怀疑。我再一次看到，我要失望了。


我一直认为你是帝国最有价值的贡献者之一。如果不是你在这方面继续固执，我对你的支持将是无限的。我敦促你重新考虑。为时不晚。


H.希姆莱
