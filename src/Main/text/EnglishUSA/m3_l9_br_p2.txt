^8MISSION 3: WEAPONS OF VENGEANCE^8

^8Part 1: Forest Compound^8

Deathshead has been tracked to a remote rocket base located near the Baltic Coast, where he intends to fire a V2 rocket at London fitted with some kind of new chemical warhead.  Your only viable method of infiltration is to stow away aboard a supply truck bound for the base.  You will parachute into the outlying forest area armed only with your knife and silenced Sten.  

The rest of your gear will be deployed separately in two drop containers.  In one of them you will find the new OSA M1S "Snooper" rifle which has been shown to be highly effective for long range, covert "wet work".  Due to the fact that this weapon uses very specialized ammunition, we can only issue you with a limited amount. Also, due to its experimental nature, it is imperative that you recover this item lest it fall into enemy hands.



任务3:复仇武器


第一部分:森林复合之路


死颅已经被追踪到位于波罗的海海岸附近的一个远程火箭基地，在那里他打算在伦敦发射一枚V2火箭，里面装有某种新的化学弹头。你唯一可行的渗透方法就是躲在一辆开往基地的补给车上。你会空降到偏远的森林地区，只带着你的刀和消音的斯登。


你的其他装备将被分开放置在两个容器中。在其中一款中，你会发现新的OSA M1S“刺探者”步枪，它已经被证明在远距离隐蔽的“湿式工作”中是非常有效。由于这种武器使用非常特殊的弹药，我们只能给你有限的子弹。同时，由于它的实验性质，你必须恢复这个项目，以免落入敌人手中。
