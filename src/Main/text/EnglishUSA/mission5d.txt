Airdropped in occupied Norway near X-Labs.  Encountered U-Boat which was seen leaving SWF.  Medium resistance encountered along approach to X-Labs entrance.  Necessary to blow through security doors, signaling my arrival to X-Labs security forces.  Encountered more "Lopers" inside facility, as well as a new class of "X-Creature" termed "Proto-Soldier".  Seven feet tall, heavily armored and very irritable, these creatures required a serious amount of firepower to bring down.  Located Deathshead's inner sanctum where I was introduced to what he called ".the pinnacle of his research".  This was the Super Soldier, a much more robust variant of the Proto-Soldier.  After considerable effort the Super Soldier was defeated, but Deathshead managed to escape.

在被占领的挪威X实验室附近空投。遇到一艘被看见离开西南风港的U型船。进入X实验室入口时遇到中等阻力。必须打开安全门，向X实验室安全部队发出我到达的信号。在设施内遇到了更多的“洛佩斯”，以及一种被称为“原始士兵”的新型“X生物”。七英尺高，重装甲和非常易怒，这些生物需要大量的火力来击落。我被介绍到他所谓的“他研究的顶峰”。这是超级战士，一个更强大的原型士兵变种。经过相当大的努力，这位超级战士被打败了，但死神设法逃走了。
