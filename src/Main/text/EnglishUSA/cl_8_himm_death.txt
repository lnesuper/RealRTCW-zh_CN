My Dear Willy,
My compliments on the amazing work achieved by your Advanced "V" Weapons Division.  Clearly, the success of this project has exceeded all expectations.  Also, I've just read the latest test reports on the "Kobra" rocket plane.  Suffice to say, I couldn't be more pleased with the results.

Unfortunately, I am not nearly as pleased with your performance on another project.  Make no mistake; OPERATION RESURRECTION is currently the Reich's single most important undertaking.  This is especially true following the Extraction Team's successfully recovery of the third Dark Knight.  I expect no less than a maximum effort from you at all times.  I sincerely hope it will never become necessary for me to remind you of this again.

Yours fondly
H. Himmler

亲爱的威廉，
我对您的高级“V”武器部门取得的惊人成就表示赞赏。 显然，该项目的成功超出了所有人的预期。 另外，我刚刚阅读了有关“眼镜蛇”火箭飞机的最新测试报告。 可以说，我对结果不满意。

不幸的是，我对您在另一个项目上的表现不满意。 不犯错误; 运营恢复是当前帝国最重要的一项任务。 在提取小组成功恢复了第三个黑暗骑士之后，尤其如此。 我希望您一直都在努力。 我衷心希望我永远都不需要再次提醒您这一点。

亲切的
希姆勒
